Transcribed random & disorganised notes taken while on a camping trip when I should have been thinking about other things:
(now organised a bit and edited to remove things already done)

When adding a new scraper
  See your repos on Github (with sync repos button)
  Don't display scrapers by default that don't have a scraper.rb file or whatever it is depending on naming convention
  After adding repos add github post hook to notify scraper of new version (maybe include option to run scraper when pushed to github?)

On scraper page
  Show README if available
  Sync button for description and version update
  Last updated date for the code last updated
  See if scraper is currently running
  See when scraper was last run
  Was the last run succesfull?
  Were there errors?
  Fork the repo on github
  Show a picture from github of scraper owner
    + who else contributed to it
    + which other scraper it was forked from
  Download as CSV
  Download as SQLite
  Show CPU time remaining?

Statistics to keep track of for each scraper
  Number of runs
  cpu time last run
  user time last run
  Total cpu time
  Total user time
  No pages scraped (urls)

Email alerts
  find out if scrapers break
  for your scrapers
  or a set of scrapers with particular tags

Limits on creating and running scrapers
  For free a certain amount of CPU time per month
  Each individual run has a limit too
    so that you don't suck up all your use
  Pay for private scrapers
  Pay for usage over a certain amount

Security
  Http proxy so that we can track whose scrapers are accessing which sites
  Firewall to stop outgoing connections except for 80 & 443
  Disallow scraping of domains with robots.txt set
  Stop all outgoing connections to internal network

Fork a scraper in one step:
  1. Forks on github
  2. Connects scraper to platform
  3. Redirect to new scraper page

Some possible copy
  All the ease of github for code collaboration and a way of running your scraper that couldn't be easier
  A heroku for scrapers, beautifully integrated with GitHub for code collaboration
