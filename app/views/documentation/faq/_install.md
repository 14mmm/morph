Right now you have to either [ask us to do it for you](mailto:contact@oaf.org.au) or make a pull request against one of the
morph-docker repositories which build the docker images.

The plan ([#3](https://github.com/openaustralia/morph/issues/3) [#153](https://github.com/openaustralia/morph/issues/153)
[#154](https://github.com/openaustralia/morph/issues/154)) is to make this a lot easier using Buildpacks.
For instance in Ruby you'll be able to include your own Gemfile which will be automatically loaded for you.
