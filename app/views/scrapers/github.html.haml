%h1 Add scraper from your Github repository

:markdown
  Scrapers can be written in Ruby, PHP or Python. For Ruby They need to have a file in the root
  directory called `scraper.rb`, for PHP `scraper.php` and for Python `scraper.py`.
  They should create an sqlite database in the current working directory called `#{Morph::Database.sqlite_db_filename}`.
  The main data should be written into a table called `#{Morph::Database.sqlite_table_name}`.
  The code needs to live in the master branch of the repository.
